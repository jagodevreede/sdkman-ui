# Design decisions

## Not using (de)compression in java

The JDK jars contain files with symlinks in them, this is not properly supported by for example commons-compress.
Also file permissions are not working, so files can't be executed.

Therefor the choice has been made to just use os tools like unzip and tar on osx and linux. And then bundle this
software on windows.

## native-image folder

The files generated by the agent in native-image are very os dependent, so we need a set for every os, the best solution
would be to set the `agentDir` property in the gluon plugin, however does not work. So we copy the files manually. First
in the `validate` phase and then we need to put it back manually.

## Do not use Platform.exit

JavaFX has a `Platform.exit` method that will terminate the application. This brings some issues on at lease OSX with
the shutdown hook, as that will not fire. Therefore, we close the application by calling `close` on the main stage. This
is implemented in `MainScreenController.exitApplication()`
